# collaborative_reinforcement_learning-QLearning
This repository presents a collaborative reinforcement learning approach leveraging High-Performance Computing (HPC) for training an artificial intelligence model using Q-Learning and OpenAI Gym. The system consists of a master node that manages a global model and multiple slave nodes running simulations on that model.
